\title{Simulated Item Difficulty Pool from IRW Datasets}
\format{
A data frame with N rows and 4 variables:
\describe{
\item{dataset}{Dataset identifier (character). Indicates the source dataset in IRW.}
\item{item}{Item identifier (character). A label for each item.}
\item{difficulty}{Estimated item difficulty (numeric).}
\item{SE}{Standard error of the difficulty estimate (numeric).}
}
}
\source{
Curated and compiled by the IRW package authors from selected datasets in the IRW repository.
}
\usage{
diff_long
}
\description{
A dataset of item difficulty estimates and associated standard errors compiled from a curated subset of IRW datasets.
Used internally by \code{irw_simu_diff()} to generate empirically grounded item parameters for simulation.
}
\details{
This pool includes binary-response items from IRW datasets that passed basic quality checksâ€”
specifically, datasets with less than 50\% missing data and without repeated or duplicate responses.
It is accessible to users and is used as the default source in \code{irw_simu_diff()}.
