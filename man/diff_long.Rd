\title{Simulated Item Difficulty Pool from IRW Datasets}
\format{
A data frame with N rows and 4 variables:
\describe{
\item{dataset}{Dataset identifier (character). Indicates the source dataset.}
\item{item}{Item identifier (character). A label for each item.}
\item{difficulty}{Estimated item difficulty (numeric).}
\item{SE}{Standard error of the difficulty estimate (numeric).}
}
}
\source{
Compiled from real or simulated IRW data by the package authors.
}
\usage{
diff_long
}
\description{
A dataset of item difficulty estimates and associated standard errors compiled from multiple IRW datasets.
Used internally by \code{irw_simu_diff()} to generate realistic item parameters for simulation.
}
\details{
This dataset provides a pool of empirically estimated item difficulties and uncertainty
from real or simulated IRW datasets. It is used as a default source by functions such as \code{irw_simu_diff()}
to construct realistic simulation scenarios.
