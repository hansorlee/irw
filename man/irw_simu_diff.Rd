\title{Simulate Item Difficulties from IRW or Custom Pools}
\usage{
irw_simu_diff(
  num_items = 10,
  num_replications = 1,
  irw_names = NULL,
  difficulty_pool = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_items}{Number of item difficulties to simulate per replication.}

\item{num_replications}{Number of replications to perform.
If 1, returns a numeric vector. If >1, returns a data frame.}

\item{irw_names}{Optional character vector of IRW dataset names to filter from \code{diff_long}.}

\item{difficulty_pool}{Optional custom data frame with columns \code{dataset}, \code{difficulty}, and \code{SE}.
If provided, overrides the default IRW difficulty pool (\code{diff_long}).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of difficulties (if \code{num_replications = 1}), or a data frame
with \code{replication} and \code{difficulty} columns (if \code{num_replications > 1}).
}
\description{
This function generates simulated item difficulties by drawing from normal
distributions centered around existing difficulty estimates and their associated
standard errors. The result is a mixture distribution, from which new difficulties
are sampled using inverse CDF sampling.
}
\details{
By default, the function uses \code{diff_long}, a built-in dataset included in the \code{irw} package.
This dataset contains item difficulty estimates and standard errors from a curated
subset of IRW datasets. You can:
\itemize{
\item Use the full IRW difficulty pool (\code{diff_long})
\item Filter to specific IRW datasets via \code{irw_names}
\item Provide your own difficulty pool via \code{difficulty_pool}
}

This method is based on Zhang et al. (2025), which constructs realistic
empirical distributions by accounting for uncertainty around item difficulty estimates.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Use all IRW data (default)
irw_simu_diff(num_items = 5)

# Filter to specific IRW datasets
irw_simu_diff(num_items = 5, irw_names = c("psychtools_epi", "psychtools_blot"))

# Use a custom difficulty pool
my_pool <- data.frame(dataset = "x",
                      difficulty = c(-0.2, 0.1),
                      SE = c(0.1, 0.2))
irw_simu_diff(num_items = 5, difficulty_pool = my_pool)

# Explore built-in IRW difficulty pool
head(diff_long)
unique(diff_long$dataset)
}
