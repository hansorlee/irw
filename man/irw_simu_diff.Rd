\title{Simulate Item Difficulties from IRW or Custom Pools}
\usage{
irw_simu_diff(
  num_items = 10,
  num_replications = 1,
  irw_names = NULL,
  difficulty_pool = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_items}{Number of item difficulties to simulate per replication.}

\item{num_replications}{Number of independent sets of item difficulties to generate.
If \code{num_replications = 1}, a numeric vector is returned. Otherwise, a data frame with
\code{replication} and \code{difficulty} columns is returned.}

\item{irw_names}{Optional. Character vector of dataset names from the IRW difficulty pool to include.}

\item{difficulty_pool}{Optional. A custom data frame with columns \code{dataset}, \code{difficulty}, and \code{SE}.
Overrides \code{irw_names} and defaults if provided.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector (if one replication) or a data frame (if multiple replications).
}
\description{
Simulates item difficulties by sampling from distributions based on estimated
difficulties and standard errors. By default, this function uses a built-in pool
of item difficulties estimated from the Item Response Warehouse (IRW).
}
\details{
Users can (1) use the full IRW pool, (2) filter to specific IRW datasets via \code{irw_names},
or (3) supply a custom difficulty pool with columns \code{dataset}, \code{difficulty}, and \code{SE}.

This method is based on Zhang et al. (2025), which constructs mixture distributions
for each dataset and samples from the empirical uncertainty via inverse CDF sampling.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Use all IRW data (default)
irw_simu_diff(num_items = 5)

# Filter to specific IRW datasets
irw_simu_diff(num_items = 5, irw_names = c("gilbert_meta_22", "gilbert_meta_23"))

# Use custom difficulty pool
pool <- data.frame(dataset = "x", difficulty = c(-0.2, 0.1), SE = c(0.1, 0.2))
irw_simu_diff(num_items = 5, difficulty_pool = pool)
}
