\title{Simulate Item Difficulties Based on Uncertainty}
\usage{
simu_diff(difficulty_data, num_items = 10, num_replications = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{difficulty_data}{A data frame with columns \code{dataset}, \code{difficulty}, and \code{SE}
(standard error).
If \code{NULL}, the function uses the internal dataset \code{diff_long} provided with the package.}

\item{num_items}{Integer. Number of item difficulties to simulate per replication.}

\item{num_replications}{Integer. Number of replications to perform.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing simulated item difficulties with replication labels.
}
\description{
This function generates simulated item difficulties by drawing from normal
distributions centered around existing difficulty estimates with associated
standard errors. The result is a mixture distribution from which new difficulties
are sampled.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  sim_result <- simu_diff(diff_long, num_items = 5, num_replications = 2)
  head(sim_result)
}
