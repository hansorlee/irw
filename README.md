# irwpkg

The goal of `irwpkg` is to make it easy to access datasets from the [Item Response Warehouse (IRW)](https://datapages.github.io/irw/).

## Installation

``` r
# Install the development version of irwpkg from GitHub
remotes::install_github("hansorlee/irwpkg")
```

## Usage

After installation, load the `irwpkg` in your R session:

``` r
library(irwpkg)
```

### IMPORTANT: Redivis Authentication

The IRW datasets are hosted on [Redivis](https://redivis.com), a data management platform. To access these datasets, you'll need to:

1.  Have a Redivis account (create one at <https://redivis.com/?createAccount> if you don't have one).

2.  Complete a one-time authentication process using the Redivis R Client requiring a pop-up:

    1.  When you first use a function in `irwpkg` that connects to Redivis, a browser window will open, prompting you to sign in to your Redivis account.

    2.  After signing in, allow access for the Redivis R Client by clicking **Allow**.

    3.  Once authentication is successful, close the browser window. You will see the message “Authentication was successful” in the R console.

**Note:** You only need to authenticate once per session. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Redivis R Client documentation](https://apidocs.redivis.com/client-libraries/redivis-r/getting-started).

## Troubleshooting

#### Authentication Issues

-   No Browser Pop-up: If the browser window doesn't open automatically, check your pop-up blocker settings.

-   Authentication errors: If you see an authentication error, try clearing your browser cookies and attempting again.
